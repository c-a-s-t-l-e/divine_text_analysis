# Divine Text Analysis

This is a repo dedicated to attempts at analyzing scriptural text. 

Basically, what that means is that there's currently **two sections** in this repo that assist in trying to better understand the texts that can be found [here](https://scriptures.nephi.org/):

1. **Notebooks** - just some basic Jupyter Notebooks that can be browsed through
2. **Notes** - any interesting future ideas that might be interesting to try in the future, etc.

##### **As a Note**

In no way, do these notebooks attempt to make any sort of theological argument or try to attempt to go beyond simply trying to analyze the given texts.
It's left to the individual what conclusions to make.
